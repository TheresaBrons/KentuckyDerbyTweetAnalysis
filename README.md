# KentuckyDerbyTweetAnalysis

#Author's note

Here's Deepna's file to stream tweets.
https://github.com/deepnadevkar/twittersentimentanalysis/blob/master/tweetstreaming.py

I also want to write a description of how I used mongodb.


I'll write this later: I won't upload sentiment corpus, I will provide a link, though.

# What does this do?
Apparently I have lost the tweet-streaming files, so I can't remember what key words I used...
churchill downs + front-runners, kentucky derby maybe
